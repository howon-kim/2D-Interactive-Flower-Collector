Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tessellation on the Project 3 side?

A:The hexagon would be the rooms and hallways, while the tessellation would be making sure that
the rooms and hallways are connected to one another. 

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.

A:I would write tests that check if rooms are rooms, like the tests that check the dimensions of 
hexagons are correct.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: A hallway connects rooms. They are similar because they are made of TileSet.WALL and TileSet.Floor.

Q: For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: I didn’t have time to attempt my own implementation, but given some thought, I think my implementation would’ve been different in that it would have iterated different position for a hexagon with the goal of an eventual state with no overlaps. This likely would not have been very efficient. It wouldn’t have been a column wise implementation like the given one. Noticing patterns is important. 

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: An algorithm that checks if rooms are connected to hallways and that hallways are connected to rooms.
